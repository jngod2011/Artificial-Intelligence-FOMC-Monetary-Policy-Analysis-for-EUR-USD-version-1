# Artificial-Intelligence-FOMC-Monetary-Policy-Analysis-for-EUR-USD

This is the first project I've decided to do in Artificial Intelligence. I've started getting quite a passion for the subject and its potential applications. This uses natural language processing (NLP) for binary classification from a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Since this is my first project, the model is quite elementary and doesn't provide anything statistically significant on the test set (It doesn't provide a higher level of accuracy than 50%). Never-the-less, by using more advanced features in Keras, I've already gotten a statistically significant result on my test set with another model I'm currently working on.
